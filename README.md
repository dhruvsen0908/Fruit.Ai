# Fruit.AI

Fruit.AI is a web application designed to offer intelligent and seamless features like an AI-powered chatbot, FAQs section, Google Translate functionality, user authentication (login/signup), and an admin panel for managing the system.

## Features

### 1. **Chatbot**
- Fruit.AI includes an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with users and answers queries. The chatbot is designed to provide helpful responses and improve user experience by offering real-time support.

### 2. **FAQs**
- A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section is included to provide users with quick answers to common questions. This reduces the need for direct interaction with the chatbot for repetitive queries.

### 3. **Google Translate Integration**

### 4. **Login & Signup**
- Users can create an account and securely log in to access personalized features. JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication ensures secure login sessions.
- Signup allows new users to register, while login ensures authentication of existing users.
